# shakespeares_play_reviews_UI

Shakespeare has been getting a lot of reviews recently about his plays. So far he has managed to build a backend API to serve them, but he doesn’t have the chops to finish out the UI. That’s where this repo comes in.  This repo is the UI for Shakespeare's play reviews.

## Getting Started

1) Fork and clone repo to local PC.
2) If api.js file has been provided to you copy it to the 'shakespeares_play_reviews' folder.
3) Navigate to folder in terminal and run 'npm install'.
4) Next run 'npm run dev'.
5) You should now be able to see the development version at http://localhost:3000
