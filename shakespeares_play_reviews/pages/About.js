      <p>
        Shakespeare has been getting a lot of reviews recently about his plays. So far 
        he has managed to build a backend API to serve them, but he doesn’t have the 
        chops to finish out the UI. That’s where this repo comes in.  This repo is the 
        UI for Shakespeare's play reviews.
